I've created the file structure for the MATRINEM document (manus.rmd), and added some placeholder info. 
- Reference file works and reference citations in introduction works. 
  - Need to add a document to Zotero and change bib-style.
- It knits alright, and now I need to write the outline for the paper. 
  - Don't do this in the document itself. 
  - Create a new, empty text file (like this one), and write the story's outline. 
  - When happy with the outline, write a first results draft with XXXX for numbers and FIGUREs. 
    - Write short-form without caring about the wording - ChatGPT will help here. 
  - Get feedback on the draft from Anders.
  - Once happy, add numbers to the rough draft and revise.
  - Get feedback again.
  - Make tables/figures rough draft. 
  - Get feedback.
  - Improve tables/figures.
  - Once happy, write the introduction + methods
