abstract = {Purpose: To compare the degree of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)-like damage under different stress conditions in neonatal mice. Methods: 5-day-old C57BL/6 mice were assigned to: (A) breastfed and no stress factors; (B) breastfed+maternal separation (3 h daily); (C) breastfed+hypoxia+lipopolysaccharide (LPS–4 mg/kg/day); (D) hyperosmolar formula+hypoxia+LPS. Mice were killed at 9 days of life. Ileum and colon were stained for hematoxylin/eosin and blindly assessed. A scoring ≥2 was considered NEC. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA and reported as median (range). Results: Ileum—Mucosal injury was mild in group B (0.0–1). Hypoxia+LPS induced greater injury in group C (1.6, 1–2.5; p < 0.0001 to B) and D (2, 0.5–3.5; p < 0.0001 to B). There were no differences between group C and D (p = n.s.). There were no cases of NEC in group A or B, whereas NEC was present in 36 % group C and 68 % group D mice. Colon—a similar degree of mucosal injury was observed among group B (2, 1–3), C (1.7, 0–3) and D (1.5, 1–3; p = n.s.). NEC was present in 75 % of group B, 50 % of group C and 86 % of group D. Conclusion: These models establish a spectrum of intestinal injury and are useful to investigate the variability of neonatal intestinal diseases, such as NEC.},

abstract = {Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most frequent and lethal disease of the gastrointestinal tract of preterm infants. At present, NEC is thought to develop in the premature host in the setting of bacterial colonization, often after administration of non-breast milk feeds, and disease onset is thought to be due in part to a baseline increased reactivity of the premature intestinal mucosa to microbial ligands as compared with the full-term intestinal mucosa. The increased reactivity leads to mucosal destruction and impaired mesenteric perfusion and partly reflects an increased expression of the bacterial receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the premature gut, as well as other factors that predispose the intestine to a hyper-reactive state in response to colonizing microorganisms. The increased expression of TLR4 in the premature gut reflects a surprising role for this molecule in the regulation of normal intestinal development through its effects on the Notch signalling pathway. This Review will examine the current approach to the diagnosis and treatment of NEC, provide an overview of our current knowledge regarding its molecular underpinnings and highlight advances made within the past decade towards the development of specific preventive and treatment strategies for this devastating disease.},

abstract = {Background Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory bowel disease of preterm human newborns with yet unresolved etiology. An established neonatal murine model for NEC employs oral administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) combined with hypoxia/hypothermia. In adult mice, feeding dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) represents a well-established model for experimental inflammatory bowel disease. Here we investigated the effect of DSS administration on the neonatal murine intestine in comparison with the established NEC model. Methods 3-day-old C57BL/6J mice were either fed formula containing DSS or LPS. LPS treated animals were additionally stressed by hypoxia/hypothermia twice daily. After 72 h, mice were euthanized, their intestinal tissue harvested and analyzed by histology, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. For comparison, adult C57BL/6J mice were fed with DSS for 8 days and examined likewise. Untreated, age matched animals served as controls. Results Adult mice treated with DSS exhibited colonic inflammation with significantly increased Cxcl2 mRNA expression. In contrast, tissue inflammation in neonatal mice treated with DSS or LPS plus hypoxia/hypothermia was present in colon and small intestine as well. Comparative analysis of neonatal mice revealed a significantly increased lesion size and intestinal Cxcl2 mRNA expression after DSS exposure. Whereas LPS administration mainly induced local neutrophil recruitment, DSS treated animals displayed increased monocytes/macrophages infiltration. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the potential of DSS to induce NEC-like lesions accompanied by a significant humoral and cellular immune response in the small and large intestine of neonatal mice. The new model therefore represents a good alternative to LPS plus hypoxia/hypothermia administration requiring no additional physical stress.},

However, the selection of which cytokines to target, and in particular the identification of which cytokines regulate the rate-limiting steps of disease pathways, is crucial to the success of such strategies. Moreover, balancing the need for ablating pathological inflammatory responses and simultaneously maintaining the ability to control infectious agents is a key consideration.

abstract = {Antibiotics are frequently administered orally to treat bacterial infections not necessarily related to the gastrointestinal system. This has adverse effects on the commensal gut microbial community, as it disrupts the intricate balance between specific bacterial groups within this ecosystem, potentially leading to dysbiosis. We hypothesized that modulation of community composition and function induced by antibiotics affects intestinal integrity depending on the antibiotic administered. To address this a total of 60 Wistar rats (housed in pairs with 6 cages per group) were dosed by oral gavage with either amoxicillin (AMX), cefotaxime (CTX), vancomycin (VAN), metronidazole (MTZ), or water (CON) daily for 10-11 days. Bacterial composition, alpha diversity and caecum short chain fatty acid levels were significantly affected by AMX, CTX and VAN, and varied among antibiotic treatments. A general decrease in diversity and an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was observed for all three antibiotics. Additionally, the relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae was increased in the CTX group and both Lactobacillaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae were increased in the VAN group compared to the CON group. No changes in microbiota composition or function were observed following MTZ treatment. Intestinal permeability to 4 kDa FITC-dextran decreased after CTX and VAN treatment and increased following MTZ treatment. Plasma haptoglobin levels were increased by both AMX and CTX but no changes in expression of host tight junction genes were found in any treatment group. A strong correlation between the level of caecal succinate, the relative abundance of Clostridiaceae 1 family in the caecum, and the level of acute phase protein haptoglobin in blood plasma was observed. In conclusion, antibiotic-induced changes in microbiota may be linked to alterations in intestinal permeability, although the specific interactions remain to be elucidated as changes in permeability did not always result from major changes in microbiota and vice versa.},

Gastrointestinal (GI) colonization of two-day-old (P2) rats leads to invasion of the blood within 48 h of initiation of colonization; pups become progressively less susceptible to infection over the P2-P9 period. We show that, in animals colonized at P2 but not at P9, E. coli K1 bacteria gain access to the enterocyte surface in the mid-region of the small intestine and translocate through the epithelial cell monolayer by an intracellular pathway to the submucosa. In this region of the GI tract, the protective mucus barrier is poorly developed but matures to full thickness over P2-P9, coincident with the development of resistance to invasion. At P9, E. coli K1 bacteria are physically separated from villi by the mucus layer and their numbers controlled by mucus-embedded antimicrobial peptides, preventing invasion of host tissues.},

abstract = {Background & Aims: Preterm birth and formula feeding are key risk factors associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants, but little is known about intestinal conditions that predispose to disease. Thus, structural, functional, and microbiologic indices were used to investigate the etiology of spontaneous NEC development in preterm pigs. Methods: Piglets were delivered by cesarean section at 92% gestation, reared in infant incubators, and fed infant formula or colostrum every 3 hours (n = 120) until tissue collection at 1-2 days of age. Results: Clinical and histopathologic signs of NEC were observed in 57% of pigs fed FORMULA (26/46) and in 5% of pigs fed COLOSTRUM (2/38) (P < .05). Relative to COLOSTRUM, both healthy and sick FORMULA pigs had reduced intestinal villous heights, enzyme activities, nutrient absorption, and antioxidant levels and higher inducible nitric oxide synthetase activity (P < .05). In healthy pigs, mucosal microbial diversity remained low and diet independent. NEC pigs showed bacterial overgrowth, and a high mucosal density of Clostridium perfringens was detected in some but not all pigs. Germ-free conditions and antiserum against Clostridium perfringens toxin prevented intestinal dysfunction and NEC in formula-fed pigs, whereas the gut trophic factors, epidermal growth factor, and glucagon-like peptide 2 had limited effects. Conclusions: A subclinical, formula-induced mucosal atrophy and dysfunction predispose to NEC and bacterial overgrowth. The adverse feeding effects are colonization dependent and may be reduced by factors in colostrum that include antibodies against aggressive toxins such as those of Clostridium perfringens. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Gastroenterological Association Institute.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about factors that regulate intestinal epithelial differentiation; microbial recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 might be involved. We investigated whether intestinal TLR4 regulates epithelial differentiation and is involved in development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) of the immature intestine. METHODS: Mice with conditional disruption of TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium and TLR4 knockout (TLR4-/-) mice were generated by breeding TLR4loxp/loxp mice with villin-cre and Ella-cre, respectively. Enterocytes that did not express or overexpressed TLR4 were created by lentiviral or adenoviral transduction. Intestinal organoids were cultured on tissue matrices. Bile acids were measured by colorimetric assays, and microbial composition was determined by 16S pyrosequencing. NEC was induced in 7- to 10-day-old mice by induction of hypoxia twice daily for 4 days. RESULTS: TLR4-/- mice and mice with enterocyte-specific deletion of TLR4 were protected from NEC; epithelial differentiation into goblet cells was increased via suppressed Notch signaling in the small intestinal epithelium. TLR4 also regulates differentiation of goblet cells in intestinal organoid and enterocyte cell cultures; differentiation was increased on deletion of TLR4 and restored when TLR4 was expressed ectopically. TLR4 signaling via Notch was increased in intestinal tissue samples from patients with NEC, and numbers of goblet cells were reduced. 16S pyrosequencing revealed that wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice had similar microbial profiles; increased numbers of goblet cells were observed in mice given antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: TLR4 deficiency reduced levels of luminal bile acids in vivo, and addition of bile acids to TLR4-deficient cell cultures prevented differentiation of goblet cells. TLR4 signaling and Notch are increased in intestinal tissues of patients with NEC and required for induction of NEC in mice. TLR4 prevents goblet cell differentiation, independently of the microbiota. Bile acids might initiate goblet cell development. {\textcopyright} 2012 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {Necrotizing enterocolitis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants and is characterized by initial feeding intolerance and abdominal distention followed by the rapid progression to coagulation necrosis of the intestine and death in many cases. Although the risk factors for NEC development remain well accepted, namely premature birth and formula feeding, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Current thinking indicates that NEC develops in response to an abnormal interaction between the mucosal immune system of the premature host and an abnormal indigenous microflora, leading to an exaggerated mucosal inflammatory response and impaired mesenteric perfusion. In seeking to understand the molecular and cellular events leading to NEC, various animal models have been developed. However, the large number and variability between the available animal models and the unique characteristics of each has raised important questions regarding the validity of particular models for NEC research. In an attempt to provide some guidance to the growing community of NEC researchers, we now seek to review the key features of the major NEC models that have been developed in mammalian and nonmammalian species and to assess the advantages, disadvantage, challenges and major scientific discoveries yielded by each. A strategy for model validation is proposed, the principal models are compared, and future directions and challenges within the field of NEC research are explored. {\textcopyright} 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) increases the risk of brain injury and impaired neurodevelopment. Rapid brain maturation prior to birth may explain why preterm brains are particularly vulnerable to serious infections. Using pigs as models, we hypothesized that preterm birth was associated with altered blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB) function and cerebral structural deficits, and that NEC was associated with systemic inflammation, BCSFB disruption, and neuroinflammation. First, cesarean-delivered preterm and term pigs (n = 43-44) were euthanized at birth to investigate BCSFB function and markers of brain structural maturation, or on day 5 to measure markers of blood-brain barrier maturation in the hippocampus and striatum (experiment 1). Next, preterm pigs (n = 162) were fed increasing volumes of infant formula to assess NEC lesions, systemic inflammation, BCSFB permeability, cerebral histopathology, hippocampal micro-glial density, and cytokine levels on day 5 (experiments 2 and 3). In experiment 1, preterm newborns had increased CSF-plasma ratios of albumin and raffinose, reduced CSF glucose levels, as well as increased cerebral hydration and reduced white matter myelination compared with term animals. We observed lower hippocampal (but not striatal) perivascular astrocyte coverage for the first 5 days after preterm birth, accompanied by altered cell junction protein levels. In experiments 2 and- 3, piglets with severe NEC lesions showed reduced blood thrombocytes and increased plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels. NEC was associated with increased CSF-plasma albumin and raffinose ratios, reduced CSF leukocyte numbers, and increased cerebral hydration. In the hippocampus, NEC was associated with pyramidal neuron loss and increased interleukin-6 levels. In the short term, NEC did not affect cerebral myelination or microglia density. In conclusion, altered BCSFB properties and brain structural deficits were observed in pigs after preterm birth. Acute gastrointestinal NEC lesions were associated with systemic inflammation, increased BCSFB permeability and region-specific neuronal damage. The results demonstrate the importance of early interventions against NEC to prevent brain injury in preterm infants.},

abstract = {Preterm infants are susceptible to infection and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and are often treated with antibiotics. Simultaneous administration of enteral and parenteral antibiotics during the first days after preterm birth prevents formula-induced NEC lesions in pigs, but it is unknown which administration route is most effective. We hypothesized that only enteral antibiotics suppress gut bacterial colonization and NEC progression in formula-fed preterm pigs. Caesarean-delivered preterm pigs (90–92% of gestation) were fed increasing amounts of infant formula from birth to day 5 and given saline (CON) or antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole) via the enteral (ENT) or parenteral (PAR) route (n = 16–17). NEC lesions, intestinal morphology, function, microbiology, and inflammatory mediators were evaluated. NEC lesions were completely prevented in ENT pigs, whereas there were high incidences of mild NEC lesions (59–63%) in CON and PAR pigs (P < 0.001). ENT pigs had elevated intestinal weight, villus height/crypt depth ratio, and goblet cell density and reduced gut permeability, mucosal adherence of bacteria, IL-8 levels, colonic lactic acid levels, and density of Gram-positive bacteria, relative to CON pigs (P < 0.05). Values in PAR pigs were intermediate with few affected parameters (reduced lactic acid levels and density and adherence of Gram-positive bacteria, relative to CON pigs, P < 0.05). There was no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance following the treatments. We conclude that enteral, but not parenteral, administration of antibiotics reduces gut bacterial colonization, inflammation, and NEC lesions in newborn, formula-fed preterm pigs. Delayed colonization may support intestinal structure, function, and immunity in the immediate postnatal period of formulafed preterm neonates.},

abstract = {Preterm birth and formula feeding predispose to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants. As mother's milk is often absent following preterm delivery, infant formula (IF) and human donor milk (HM) are frequently used as alternatives. We have previously shown that porcine and bovine colostrum (BC) provide similar NEC protection in preterm piglets relative to IF. We hypothesized that HM exerts similar effects and that this effect is partly species-independent. Preterm piglets (n = 40) received 2 days of total parenteral nutrition, followed by a rapid transition to full enteral feeding (15 ml•kg-1•2 h-1) for 2 days using BC (n = 13), HM (n = 13), or IF (n = 14). Intestinal passage time and hexose absorption were tested in vivo. Body and organ weights were recorded on day 5, and macroscopic NEC lesions in the gastrointestinal tract were assessed. Intestinal samples were collected for determination of histomorphology, histopathology, tissue IL-6 and IL-8, organic acids, bacterial adherence by fluorescence in situ hybridization score, and digestive enzyme activities. Relative to IF, pigs from BC and HM showed longer intestinal passage time; higher weight gain, hexose absorptive capacity, mucosal proportion, and enzyme activities; lower NEC incidence, organic acid concentration, and IL-8 concentration; and reduced histopathology lesions. Tissue IL-6 concentration and bacterial adherence score were lower for HM, relative to both BC and IF groups. We conclude that BC and HM are both superior to IF in stimulating gut structure, function, and NEC resistance in preterm piglets. BC may be a relevant alternative to HM when mother's milk is unavailable during the first week after preterm birth. {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acute gut inflammatory disorder that occurs in preterm infants in the first weeks after birth. Infants surviving NEC often show impaired neurodevelopment. The mechanisms linking NEC lesions with later neurodevelopment are poorly understood but may include proinflammatory signaling in the immature brain. Using preterm pigs as a model for preterm infants, we hypothesized that severe intestinal NEC lesions are associated with acute effects on the developing hippocampus. Methods: Cesarean-delivered preterm pigs (n=117) were reared for 8days and spontaneously developed variable severity of NEC lesions. Neonatal arousal, physical activity, and in vitro neuritogenic effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were investigated in pigs showing NEC lesions in the colon (Co-NEC) or in the small intestine (Si-NEC). Hippocampal transcriptome analysis and qPCR were used to assess gene expressions and their relation to biological processes, including neuroinflammation, and neural plasticity. Microglia activation was quantified by stereology. The neuritogenic response to selected proteins was investigated in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Results: NEC development rapidly reduced the physical activity of pigs, especially when lesions occurred in the small intestine. Si-NEC and Co-NEC were associated with 27 and 12 hippocampal differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. These included genes related to neuroinflammation (i.e., S100A8, S100A9, IL8, IL6, MMP8, SAA, TAGLN2) and hypoxia (i.e., PDK4, IER3, TXNIP, AGER), and they were all upregulated in Si-NEC pigs. Genes related to protection against oxidative stress (HBB, ALAS2) and oligodendrocytes (OPALIN) were downregulated in Si-NEC pigs. CSF collected from NEC pigs promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro, and the S100A9 and S100A8/S100A9 proteins may mediate the neuritogenic effects of NEC-related CSF on hippocampal neurons. NEC lesions did not affect total microglial cell number but markedly increased the proportion of Iba1-positive amoeboid microglial cells. Conclusions: NEC lesions, especially when present in the small intestine, are associated with changes to hippocampal gene expression that potentially mediate neuroinflammation and disturbed neural circuit formation via enhanced neuronal differentiation. Early brain-protective interventions may be critical for preterm infants affected by intestinal NEC lesions to reduce their later neurological dysfunctions.},

abstract = {Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal disease of the premature infant. One of the most important long-term complications observed in children who survive NEC early in life is the development of profound neurological impairments. However, the pathways leading to NEC-associated neurological impairments remain unknown, thus limiting the development of prevention strategies. We have recently shown that NEC development is dependent on the expression of the lipopolysaccharide receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the intestinal epithelium, whose activation by bacteria in the newborn gut leads to mucosal inflammation. Here, we hypothesized that damage-induced production of TLR4 endogenous ligands in the intestine might lead to activation of microglial cells in the brain and promote cognitive impairments. We identified a gut-brain signaling axis in an NEC mouse model in which activation of intestinal TLR4 signaling led to release of high-mobility group box 1 in the intestine that, in turn, promoted microglial activation in the brain and neurological dysfunction. We further demonstrated that an orally administered dendrimer-based nanotherapeutic approach to targeting activated microglia could prevent NEC-associated neurological dysfunction in neonatal mice. These findings shed light on the molecular pathways leading to the development of NEC-associated brain injury, provide a rationale for early removal of diseased intestine in NEC, and indicate the potential of targeted therapies that protect the developing brain in the treatment of NEC in early childhood.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To define the nature and frequency of brain injury and brain growth impairment in very preterm (VPT) infants by using MRI at term-equivalent age and to relate these findings to perinatal risk factors and 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHODS: MRI scans at term-equivalent age from 3 VPT cohorts (n = 325) were reviewed. The severity of brain injury, including periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular and cerebellar hemorrhage, was graded. Brain growth was assessed by using measures of biparietal width (BPW) and interhemispheric distance. Neurodevelopmental outcome at age 2 years was assessed across all cohorts (n = 297) by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID-II) or Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III), and evaluation for cerebral palsy. RESULTS: Of 325 infants, 107 (33%) had some grade of brain injury and 33 (10%) had severe injury. Severe brain injury was more common in infants with lower Apgar scores, necrotizing enterocolitis, inotropic support, and patent ductus arteriosus. Severe brain injury was associated with delayed cognitive and motor development and cerebral palsy. Decreased BPW was related to lower gestational age, inotropic support, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, prolonged parenteral nutrition, and oxygen at 36 weeks and was associated with delayed cognitive development. In contrast, increased interhemispheric distance was related to male gender, dexamethasone use, and severe brain injury. It was also associated with reduced cognitive development, independent of BPW. CONCLUSIONS: At term-equivalent age, VPT infants showed both brain injury and impaired brain growth on MRI. Severe brain injury and impaired brain growth patterns were independently associated with perinatal risk factors and delayed cognitive development.
