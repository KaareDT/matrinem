Welcome to the online data and code repository for MATRINEM - my master thesis project at UCPH.

This folder contains all code, including underlying data, used in the final manuscript. In the root directory you'll find 3 folders "code", "data" and "results". These contain pretty much what the name suggests. In each is another README file, which tells you what is in the folder and how to execute it. 

Everything in here is for R and Rstudio, and I advise you to work from within the project file "2022_matrinem_thesis". Make sure to render ("knit") from the current project working directory, otherwise, paths til files won't work. 

I hope you enjoy whatever you find. For questions or requests, please contact cxb592@ku.dk.
